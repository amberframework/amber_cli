# Inflector Library Migration Plan

## Goal
Remove external `inflector` shard dependency by vendoring the library into our project and improving it to fix known issues while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## Current State Analysis

### External Dependency
- **Library**: `phoffer/inflector.cr` (v0.1.8)
- **Location**: External shard in `shard.yml`
- **Usage**: Only 4 methods used from the library

### Current Usage Points
```crystal
# In src/amber_cli/core/word_transformer.cr:
Inflector.singularize(word)    # Line 122
Inflector.pluralize(word)      # Line 125  
Inflector.classify(word)       # Line 150
Inflector.foreign_key(word)    # Line 157
```

### Known Issues to Fix
1. **"foot" ‚Üí "foots"** instead of "feet" (currently fixed with custom override)
2. **Potential other irregular plurals** that need investigation
3. **Performance improvements** using Crystal's built-in methods where possible

### Test Coverage
- **359 lines** of comprehensive tests in `spec/core/word_transformer_spec.cr`
- **Edge cases covered**: empty strings, single chars, irregular plurals, acronyms
- **Performance tests**: 1000 iterations for built-in methods
- **Custom conventions**: Pattern overrides and fallbacks

## Risk Mitigation

### üö® **Potential Risks & Solutions:**

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - *Risk*: Vendored version behaves differently
   - *Solution*: Comprehensive comparison testing before migration

2. **Performance Regression**  
   - *Risk*: New implementation slower than original
   - *Solution*: Benchmark at each step, optimize hot paths

3. **Missing Edge Cases**
   - *Risk*: Original library handles cases we missed
   - *Solution*: Extract complete test suite from original library

4. **Maintenance Burden**
   - *Risk*: Now responsible for maintaining inflector code
   - *Solution*: Well-documented, simple implementation with comprehensive tests
